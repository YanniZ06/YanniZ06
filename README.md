# Actual README whenever 
### Hello!!
I'm Yanni, an 18 y/o Highschool student with roughly 4 years of experience!
Most experienced with the Haxe programming language, grooved into C & C++ aswell and soon grooving into Java for the job market.
I do programming solely as a hobby as of now, my biggest project being a general purpose framework named Myztic (check it out!)

#### Most of my old stats are private unfortunately, need to fill this with content though
